  <h2>Full stack web developer</h2>
  <h3 class="name">pro level web developer </h3>
  <p>A full-stack web developer is a person who can develop both client and server software. They are proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments. In other words, they can build and maintain both the front-end and the back-end of a website.</p>

<div id="front" class="half-width single">
  <h2>Front end developer</h2>
  <h3 class="name">noob web developer</h3>
<p>A front-end web developer is someone who creates websites and web applications. The difference between front-end and back-end is that front-end refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works. You can think of front-end as client-side and back-end as server-side</p>
